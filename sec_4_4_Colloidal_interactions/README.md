**Potential analysis**

Run [Fig24.m](Potential_analyisis/Fig24.m) to obtain (a)Time evolution of the probability density distribution of the inter-particlesdistance r (t) obtained from 400 different trajectories after the optical traps are switched off att = 0 ms for decreasing values of T: (a) T = 4562mK, (b) 2002mK, (c) 1632mK,and (d) 108  2mK. The solid lines indicate representative individual trajectories while thecoloured background represents the . The dashed horizontal line indicates the distance rcorresponding to the diameter d of the colloids. Sometimes r (t) is smaller than d becausea displacement of the colloids along the vertical z-axis causes their projections onto thexy-plane to overlap. This occurs more frequently in the presence of critical Casimir forcesand particularly if the particles are stuck together. These cases, however, are rare comparedto those in which the particles do not leave the xy-plane. (e-h) Equilibrium distributionPeq(r) of the inter-particle distance r (0) (i.e., when the optical tweezers are switched off)for two optically trapped colloids at temperatures (f) T = 456  2mK, (g) 200  2mK, (h)1632mK, and (i) 1082mK. Each histogram is obtained from 400 different experimentalvalues. The solid black lines are the theoretical distribution of r (0), obtained via MonteCarlo integration (106 samples) of two optically trapped particles subjected to the theoreticaltotal potential V (R1;R2)

**Drift analysis**

RuRun [Fig26.m](Drift_analysis/Drift_velocities/Fig26.m) to obtain(a) Experimental values of the normalized parallel Dk=D0 (circles) and perpendicularD?=D0 (triangles) diffusion constants as functions of r=d. The parallel and perpendiculardirections refer to the line connecting the centers of the two colloids, and D0 is the bulkdiffusion constant (Eq. (35)) calculated from experimental data. The various colors referto data taken at T = 456  2mK (blue), 273  2mK (light blue), 200  2mK (green),163  2mK (yellow), 127  2mK (orange), and 108  2mK (red). The solid lines representthe theoretical predictions accounting for the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction betweenthe colloids [193]. Errors bars represent the standard deviation of the experimental values.The nature of the deviations observed in Dk at short and long distances is discussedin the main text.

Parallel vk (second row) and perpendicular v? (third row), driftvelocities, respectively, to the direction connecting the centers of the two colloids for (b, f)T = 456  2mK, (c, g) 200  2mK, (d, h) 163  2mK and (e, i) 108  2mK. In the secondand third row, the symbols with errorbars represent the experimental data, and the thick,coloured lines represent the corresponding simulation results. The shaded areas representthe error of the numerical estimates due to the uncertainties in the fit parameters.
