# Section 4.5 Statistical Physics

This folder contains the codes to analyze the data obtained from a  Fluactuation Dissipation FDT
around a NESS with the use of optical tweezers
 



**Kramers transitions and stochastic resonance**

(a) Typical trajectories Θ(t) of a colloidal particle in a NESS, defined over the inverval [0,∞). The dashed line represents the mean drift, <θ(t)><sub>0</sub> = 2πjt+ const :, due to the non-zero probability current j induced by thenon-conservative term F. Inset: example of trajectory θ(t) defined over [0, 2π) (b) NESS probability
density function of θ, defined over [0, 2π) (bars) and reconstructed potential energy U(θ) (solid
line). The arrow indicates the direction of the non-conservative force f<sub>0</sub>, which shifts the maximum
of ρ<sub>NESS</sub>(θ) to the right relative to the minimum of U(θ). Inset: comparison between the NESS
distribution ρ<sub>NESS</sub>(θ) and the equilibrium one ρ<sub>eq</sub> (θ) (F = 0, sharp peak). (c) Correlation function between the observable Q(θ) = sin θ and the variable V (θ) = sin θ. (d) NESS correlation functions
involved in the integral form of the generalized FDT (47): C(0) - C(t) (dotted-dashed line), B(t )
(dashed line) and C(0) - C(t ) - B(t ) (solid line). Inset: estimate of the response function R(t ) by
means of the time derivative of [C(0) 􀀀C(t )]=(kBT ) (dotted-dashed line), and taking into account the
corrective term, [C(0) -C(t ) - B(t )]/(k<sub>B</sub>T ) (solid line).


The data file is contained in the data file [trajNESS_data.txt](data/trajNESS_data.txt).
