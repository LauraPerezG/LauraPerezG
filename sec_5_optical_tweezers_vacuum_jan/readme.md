# Section 5 Optical tweezers in vacuum

This folder contains the codes to analyze the data obtained from the experiments with optical tweezers in vacuum.



**Mass Calibration**


(a) Quadrature component
of particle oscillation in response to a driving voltage, demodulated in a bandwidth of 7 Hz.
The high-voltage (HV) discharge is turned on at t = 0. The oscillation amplitude changes in
discrete steps while the high voltage is on. (b) Preparation of charge state. The high voltage
is turned off at t = 0, while the particle carries a net charge of 1e. The charge stays constant
over the remainder of the measurement.
