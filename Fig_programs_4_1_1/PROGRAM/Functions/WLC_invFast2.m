% P is the persistence length in [nm], KbT is in [pN*nm], the force is
% given in [pN]. The force must be positive.
% IMPORTANT: the function returns the value "z" of the normalized extension
% z=x_stretch/contour_length. Hence z is always in the interval [0,1]
% NOTE 1: this function works with f as a vector or scalar argument.
% Optionnaly, KbT can also be provided as vector of a size identical to f.
