Files Water.txt, PNP.txt and CPyCl4mM.txt are needed to run PosAutocorrelationFunction.m and get the plots and fits 
of Figure 2(a) and (b) on the manuscript. The first column of these files contains the particle position (a), while the 
second has the correspondinf times. A .mat version of these data is also given with the same information.


File CPyCl5mM.txt is needed to run PassiveMicrorheologyKramersKronig and get the plots of Figs. 2(c) and (d).
This file contains the particle position (first column) and the corresponding time (second column).
