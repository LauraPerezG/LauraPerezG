# Section 5 Vacuum

This folder contains the codes to analyze the data obtained from the double well potential experiment.
 



**Kramers transitions and stochastic resonance**


(a) Quadrature componentof particle oscillation in response to a driving voltage, demodulated in a bandwidth of 7 Hz.The high-voltage (HV) discharge is turned on at t = 0. The oscillation amplitude changes indiscrete steps while the high voltage is on. (b) Preparation of charge state. The high voltageis turned off at t = 0, while the particle carries a net charge of 1e. The charge stays constantover the remainder of the measurement. Figure reproduced from [426]
